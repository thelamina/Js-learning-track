# Contributing to Js-learning-track

We want to make contributing to this repo to be as easy as possible, whether it is:

- Forking the repo
- Creating your own branch
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of someone else's code
- Submitting a fix

## We'll use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow]
And we'll actively monitor pull requests

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License] that's a concern.


## On the creation of your own learning progress branch
- Fork repo
- Create your branch from `master`.
- Name your branch in the manner `github_username-learning-progress`, so everyone knows the awesome developer who just took up Js as  a programming language ie `themaleem-learning-progress` 
- Remember to regularly update your forked repo from this repo's master. See **[THIS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7244321/how-do-i-update-a-github-forked-repository)** for better understanding
- Update README.md **contributors** section with your github username or profile: `[Themaleem](https://github.com/themaleem)`
- Issue that pull request! ðŸš€

  ### On maintaining your own branch
  - In the `track` folder located in your `github_username_learning-progress` branch,
  - Create a new folder ðŸ“‚ with your username eg `themalem\` 
  - and in your username folder ðŸ“‚ create a new subfolder ðŸ“‚ for each topic you're learning ie you will end up with  
      - **`track\themaleem\js-variables`** (if you're learning about javascript variables)
      - **`track\themaleem\js-objects`**   (if you're learning about javascript objects)
  - These  subfolders will then hold the codes and notes specific to the topic
  
  
## Report bugs using Github's issues 
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report someone wrote, and I think it's not a bad model.
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. 
  - What you expected would happen
  - What actually happens 
  

Use a Consistent Coding Style
